# Github Graph Mapper
An automated tool to visualize connections between followers on Github. Simply give the tool a username and it will automatically map out which users, follow which users, starting from the given user. This is visualized using the graph database, Neo4J.

## Environment variables
In order to run the script, the needed environment variables are needed:
* ``NEO4J_URI`` - Default is ``bolt://localhost:7687"``
* ``NEO4J_USER`` - Default is `neo4j`
* ``NEO4J_PASS`` - Default is `password`

And the optional variable to increase rate limits:
* `GITHUB_TOKEN` - This should be a Personal Access Token with access to the `Followers` scope.

## Usage
